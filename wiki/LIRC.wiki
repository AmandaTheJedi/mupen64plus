#summary Enabling LIRC support in Mupen64Plus.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

Mupen64Plus now supports interfacing with a [http://www.lirc.org Linux Infrared Remote Control] (LIRC) daemon. This can be used to send commands to Mupen64Plus using a remote control.


= Building with LIRC support =

To build Mupen64Plus with LIRC support, download and unzip the source code (see [README README] for details), and pass "LIRC=1" to when building:

{{{
 $ make LIRC=1 all
}}}

= Configuring LIRC Commands =

The lirc config file defines mappings between buttons on your remote control (as defined in lircd.conf) and the commands you want to send Mupen64Plus. Mupen64Plus expects the lirc config to be in a file called .lircrc in the user's home directory.

The lirc config file should contain a stanza for each button mapping. Here is an example stanza:

{{{
begin
   prog = mupen64plus
   button = Back/Exit
   config = quit
end
}}}

This defines the "Back/Exit" button on the remote control to the "quit" mupen64plus command.

= Supported Commands =

The following table lists the Mupen64Plus commands that can be mapped to remote control buttons in your lirc config file:

|| Command String || Description ||
|| 0-9 || Set current statesave slot to given slot number. ||
|| save || Save game state to currently selected statesave slot. ||
|| load || Load game statesave from currently selected statesave slot. ||
|| quit || Stop Emulation. ||
|| fullscreen || Toggle fullscreen mode. ||
|| screenshot || Take a screenshot. ||
