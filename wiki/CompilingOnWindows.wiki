= Introduction =

Hi there. We now have a Qt4 interface in trunk that seems to work on windows. If you'd like to compile it you will need the following:

 * [http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-mingw32.tar.gz SDL]
 * [http://www.trolltech.com/download?target=http://wftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/Qt/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.4.1-mingw.exe Qt4]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/dlfcn-win32/ dlfcn-win32]
 * [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW]
  * It is enough to let the Qt installer install MinGW
 * The following from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html GnuWin32]:
  * libfreetype
  * libiconv
  * libpng
  * zlib

= Details =

Install the deps mentioned above. Make sure the Qt and MinGW tools are in your path. Adjust the paths at the top of pre.mk.win32. Run the following in the trunk folder:

 * mingw32-make WIN32=1 GUI=QT4 mupen64plus

You should now have a mupen64plus.exe file. Place the needed DLL files in the right places (the easiest way is to place them in the same directory with the exe) and you should be able to start up the emulator.
