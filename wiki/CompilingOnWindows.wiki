= Introduction =

Hi there. We now have a Qt4 interface in trunk that seems to work on windows. If you'd like to compile it you will need the following:

 * [http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-mingw32.tar.gz SDL]
 * [http://www.trolltech.com/download?target=http://wftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/Qt/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.4.1-mingw.exe Qt4]
 * [http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/ pthreads-win32]
  * Get the GC2 version
 * [http://code.google.com/p/dlfcn-win32/ dlfcn-win32]
 * [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW]
  * It is enough to let the Qt installer install MinGW
 * The following from [http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html GnuWin32]:
  * libfreetype
  * libiconv
  * libpng
  * zlib

= Details =

Install the deps mentioned above. Make sure the Qt and MinGW tools are in your path. Adjust the paths at the top of Makefile.mingw. Run the following in the trunk folder:

 * mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw GUI=QT4 all

You should now have a mupen64plus.exe file. Place the needed DLL files in the right places and have fun!
