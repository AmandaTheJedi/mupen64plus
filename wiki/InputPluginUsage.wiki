#summary Supported use cases for Autoconfiguration with !Mupen64Plus-Input-SDL plugin

== Use Cases ==

 * *Use case #1 scenario*: First-time user of !Mupen64Plus, has no configuration file.
 * *Desired Behavior*:
   * Automatically detect and configure any supported joysticks, assigning them in sequence to controllers.
   * Skip any unsupported joysticks without leaving unconfigured controllers.
   * If no SDL joysticks are found, configure the keyboard/mouse.
   * Fill in settings for all 4 controllers (for GUI front-ends)

 * *Use case #2 scenario*: User changes controllers often (configuration file is present)
 * *Desired Behavior*:
   * Automatically detect and configure any joysticks plugged in
   * Skip any unsupported joysticks without leaving unconfigured controllers.
   * If no SDL joysticks are found, configure the keyboard/mouse.
   * Don't stick to old input settings in configuration file when different joysticks are present
   * User should be able to modify the auto-configured settings (edit InputAutoConfig.ini)

 * *Use case #3 scenario*: User switches between keyboard and joystick
 * *Desired Behavior*:
   * If joystick is plugged in, then set up according to configuration file (if it matches), or auto-config
   * If no SDL joysticks are found, configure the keyboard/mouse.
   * If joystick is missing but set up in configuration file, do not overwrite settings with keyboard configuration.
