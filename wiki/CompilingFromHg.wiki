= Compiling !Mupen64Plus from source code under Linux =

This guide is for people who want to play with the latest !Mupen64Plus code under development, by grabbing the source code from our development repository and compiling it yourself.

== Requirements ==

 * Build environment (GCC, G++, GNU Make, etc)
 * Development packages for dependencies
  # SDL 1.2
  # libpng
  # freetype 2
  # zlib
  # OpenGL

== Installing Mercurial ==

If you do not have Mercurial installed, launch your favorite application manager and search for *mercurial*. If you are on Ubuntu or Debian this line will work in the console:

{{{$ sudo apt-get install mercurial}}}

== Checking out, building, and updating the source code ==

Part of the re-design of our emulator has involved breaking it up from a single big package into 6 separate modules which must all be built separately.  In order to make this easier for developers, I have written a few simple shell scripts for checking out and building the code.  You make download an archive of the scripts here:

[http://bitbucket.org/richard42/mupen64plus-core/raw/f92cdb8e288e/tools/m64p_helper_scripts.tar.gz m64p_helper_scripts.tar.gz] (updated Jan 18, 2009)

To check out, build, and run the new !Mupen64Plus code, unzip these scripts into an empty directory and run:

{{{./m64p_get.sh && ./m64_build.sh && ./m64p_test.sh}}}

If, at a later time, you want to pull the latest changes and rebuild all of the code, you may do the following:

{{{./m64p_update.sh && ./m64_build.sh}}}

The build script will create a `test` directory and place all of the necessary files there.  You can go into this directory and run the console front-end (named `mupen64plus`) to run ROMs.
